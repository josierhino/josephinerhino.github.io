									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Here you can read about my background, interests, and hobbies!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Howdy, my name is Josephine but I prefer to go by Josie. I was born in Las Vegas and currently live in New York City. I attended the University of Nevada Las Vegas (Go Rebels!) where I majored in Information Systems. My favorite hobbies include painting, reading philosophy books, and playing video games. My favorite philosopher is Thomas Aquinas. My favorite eSports teams are T1 and Optic Gaming. I also have personal interests in sustainability and economic reform specifically in combating the technology gap. I believe with technology we can increase awareness, improve education for the masses, and improve societal welfare.</p>
								<p>I have 2+ years working experience in the Information Technology field. Ever since I was a kid I always had a passion for computers. I received my first laptop at age 9 and ever since then my passion for technology has bloomed and flourished. I am familiar with the programming/scripting languages Python, mySQL, R and JavaScript. I also have experience working with ServiceNow, Jira, Confluence, and AWS. I have been tinkering around with HTML while making this website and I think I have found a new interest! </p>
									I am currently seeking entry-level roles in the data analytics and cloud computing field. I would love to combine my passion for data and problem-solving skills for a company dedicated to continous learning and sustainability.  Continuous learning is a core principle for me, and I am committed to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving field of data analytics.

								 If you're looking for a passionate, adaptable, and driven data analyst, I'd love to connect with you. Together, let's uncover the untapped potential hidden within the vast sea of data and make informed decisions that propel us towards success.
